# iOS Examples

This repo contains several iOS examples. iOS 5+ and Xcode 4.2 are required.


## Closeby

Closeby is an Augmented Reality example. It uses code from the pARk sample code by Apple.

This sample demonstrates how to overlay labels for locations based on where they are in relation to you. Tapping on a label displays some information about that location.

## Geolocation

Geolocation is an example of how to use CLLocationManager to get your current location. Once you have your locatio you can use CLGeocoder to get the current street name from the current location using reverse geocoding. Forward geocoding calculates latitude and longitude based on the address.


This sample also shows you how to calculate the distance in meters between two locations.
